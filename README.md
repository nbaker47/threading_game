# Threading Game Project

This project is inteded to demonstrate the effective and safe use of threads within Java. The application is a game centered around multiple threads drawing "pebbles" (with attributed number/weight) from "bags", and seeing who can reach a certain number first.

Test results and detailed anlysation of our codebase and the data structures we chose can be found in "ECM2414 Report.odt"
